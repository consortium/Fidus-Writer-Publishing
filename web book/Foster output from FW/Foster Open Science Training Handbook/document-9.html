Currently it stands as 'we gladly feast on those who would subdue us - <em>sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc</em>'<a href="#fn2" class="fn"></a>, adopted in 2011. Working in reverse chronology the strapline was updated from; 'Culture and Politics After the Net' in 2002, going back to 'CRITICAL/INFORMATION/SERVICES' 1997, and starting as 'DIGITALARTCRITIQUE' in 1994. A constant sub-sub-stapline has been 'Proud to be Flesh', part Donna Harraway influenced the figure of the cyborg from her essay the <em>A Cyborg Manifesto</em> from the book<em> Simians, Cyborgs and Women</em><a href="#fn3" class="fn"></a> and also as a rebuttal to Wired magazine and its cyber-utopian-post-corporate-capitalist-boosterismfrom. Its worth noting that later in 2006 Fred Turner gave a great breakdown of Wired magazine and its libertarian roots in his book <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</em><a href="#fn4" class="fn"></a>, pointing to the publishing of the essay The California Ideology'<a href="#fn5" class="fn"></a> by Barbrook and Cameron, which first appeared in <em>Mute</em> 1995.</p><p>Mute began life in 1994 at the start of the web, first appearing online and simultaneously as a broadsheet newspaper, printing on the Financial Times press, practicing open access publishing long before there was a mainstream scholarly open access movement. The Internet and its different generations of pioneers were Mute's inspiration for non-stop publishing experimentation and questioning of these technocratic infrastructures and their impacts.</p></div><section class="fnlist" role="doc-footnotes"><section id="fn1" role="doc-footnote"><p><em>Ceci n’est pas un magazine</em>, Quim Gil &amp; Mute, 2001, <a href="http://www.metamute.org/sites/www.metamute.org/files/u1/ceci01.pdf" title="">http://www.metamute.org/sites/www.metamute.org/files/u1/ceci01.pdf</a></p></section><section id="fn2" role="doc-footnote"><p>we gladly feast on those who would subdue us - <em>sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc,</em> is taken directly from the The Addams Family (AKA The Munsters), created as a cartoon in 1938 by the cartoonist Charles Addams</p></section><section id="fn3" role="doc-footnote"><p><em>A Cyborg Manifesto, 1985</em>.
