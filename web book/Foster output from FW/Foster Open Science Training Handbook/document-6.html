Convincing researchers of the benefits of changing their practices, and equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to do so, is hence an important task.</span></p><p><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">This book offers guidance and resources for Open Science instructors and trainers, as well as anyone interested in improving levels of transparency and participation in research practices. Supporting and connecting an emerging Open Science community that wishes to pass on its knowledge, the handbook suggests training activities that can be adapted to various settings and target audiences. The book equips trainers with methods, instructions, exemplary training outlines and inspiration for their own Open Science trainings. It provides Open Science advocates across the globe with practical know-how to deliver Open Science principles to researchers and support staff. What works, what doesn’t? How can you make the most of limited resources? Here you will find a wealth of resources to help you build your own training events.</span></p><p><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">Building on the authors’ cumulative experience and skills of imparting Open Science principles, this handbook is oriented towards practical teaching in an open knowledge and educational setting.

This includes researchers, librarians, infrastructure providers, research support officers, funders, policy makers and decision makers. This handbook is also meant for all those who have regular or occasional contact with researchers (and other stakeholders) and wish to share their Open Science knowledge, either as part of their regular working duties or as an extra investment of time. Importantly, it will be of use to those who wish to host training events to foster reuse, participation, efficiency, equity, and sharing in research, regardless of whether they ascribe to (or even wish to use) the term Open Science.</span></p><p><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">In this handbook, we define "trainer" as any person wishing to run an Open Science training event, regardless of their levels of experience. Importantly, this includes those who would feel uncomfortable or do not wish to use the Open Science label in their teaching. The book contains advice on teaching concrete skills and concepts to improve the work of researchers. And while most fall under the umbrella term "Open Science", they needn’t be taught as such. Wariness of the label “Open Science” might mean that "Open Science" training only attracts a particular segment of researchers, whereas "How to publish your data" training attracts a more diverse group. Part of a trainer’s job is to define their target audience and how best to reach them, and so such decisions are best made by you!</span></p><figure data-equation="" data-image="12" data-figure-category="none" data-caption="" id="F92907571" data-aligned="center" data-width="100" class="aligned-center image-width-100" data-image-src="/media/images/2b202773-ec41-4cde-8558-44800112ec6d.png"><div><img src="2b202773-ec41-4cde-8558-44800112ec6d.png"></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-is-open-science"><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">What is Open Science?</span></h2><p><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">According to the </span><a href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/7"><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">FOSTER taxonomy</span></a><span class="approved-insertion" data-user="0" data-username="fawad" data-date="25816930">, "Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society."
